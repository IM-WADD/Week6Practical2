# Week 6 Practical 2 - Information Architecture
You will conduct an analysis of the York Sport website in terms of its Information Architecture. This practical is best completed in pairs or 3s, particularly for stage 2. 

## Exercise 1: Critical Analysis
Open the York Sport website (https://www.york-sport.com/).

From the home page, identify all the navigation menus for the site (there are multiple) and take note of the top-level headings and any subpages. We have cards / Post Its for you to use. Record one heading / subpage per card.

Perform a critical analysis of the information architecture design of the site. Record your comments and reflections. We will discuss as a class about 30 minutes into the session.
- It can help to imagine different personas e.g. someone new who wants to take a class, a regular user with a membership
- What IA pattern has been used e.g. flat, polyhierarchy
- Think critically: is information where your personas might expect it to be?

Refer explicitly to the IA patterns and principles discussed in the lectures (e.g. LATCH). I also recommend reading the Principles of IA by Dan Brown, which you can find on the VLE under Week 4: Reading or at this link: https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/bult.2010.1720360609

## Exercise 2: Card Sort
Perform an open card sort (ideally in groups of 2 or 3) to come up with an improved navigation structure:
1.	Group the cards into logical (to you) categories. Which cards naturally go together?
2.	Give each group a heading.

Try performing this task multiple times from different user perspectives e.g.
- Someone not affiliated with the university who has never visited a York Sport location exploring offerings with a view to potentially becoming a member or using the facilities. This user is also looking at websites for other health and sport facilities in York.
- Someone who has used a York Sport facility in the past.

You may find you can come up with multiple “natural” groupings. This is fine! 

## Exercise 3: Site Map
Based on the structure of the information you have developed through the card sort, create a site map for your new York Sport website. Remember that a site map can (and should) incorporate more than just the pages on the site, by referring to the types of information included under each section of content.
